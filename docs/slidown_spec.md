# Slidown Specs

## Vision Spec

Slidown enables users to quickly create slideshows for presentations to a small group of people or remote audiences. A user builds a slide show by composing a Markdown-like document, while focuses on content without taking layout and rendering into consideration. Slidown is not designed to be a replacement for transitional PowerPoint nor Keynote, instead people would feel convenient to use Slidown for lightweight slideshows and everyday discussions. Using Slidown might develop into an alternative expression form to email and blogging.

## Slidown Tech Spec

### Slide Elements

#### Static
- Slogan
- Picture
- List
- Text
- Code
- Table
- Chart

#### Embedded ⚒2
- Web Page
- Youtube

#### Interactive ⚒3
- Form (for Reporting)
- Ballot (Voting)

### Basic Slidown Syntax
#### Slogan and Title
Any level of headings without **payload** (following content before next heading) are rendered as a slogan in screen center.

```
### Welcome to London
```

Any level of headings with payload are rendered as title, as payload rendered below it.

```
## Olympic Game 2012
![image](url)
```

**Note:** For solo image, render should use it's file name as title if heading is empty, unless an hidden title is explicitly specified.

```
# ![image1](url1) 
#
![image2](url2)
# ![image3](url3) #
```

In the above example, Images1 and Images2 should be rendered with title, and Image3 shouldn't.

#### Payloads

Just use standard Markdown syntax. Common type of payload:

- Image
- List
- Text
- Code
- Table
- Blockquote

Multiple / mixed blocks of payload are supported.

#### Inline Text Decoration

Use standard Markdown syntax for:
- Strong and Emphasize
- Inline Code
- Links

### Extended Slidown Syntax
#### Meta Data
Store / parse meta data at the very beginning of the document inside an HTML comment.

```
<!---
theme: dark;
animation: slide-left;
-->
```

The above Markdown should be translated to HTML meta tags in the `<head>` section.

#### Hidden Title ⚒²
If the closing `#` exists, do not render title and use full screen space for payload content.

##### Normal Title:
```
# Hello
```
##### Hidden Title:
```
# Hello #
```

#### Highlight ⚒
Text enclosed by a pair of `#_` and `_#` **or ** a pair of `_#` and `#_` are converted to HTML 5 tag `<mark>` and `</mark>`.

```
Do not forget to buy #_milk_# today.
```

#### Speaker Note ⚒²

A pair of dual-slash `//` inclose a piece of speaker note. Render should convert the pair of marker to HTML tag `<dfn>` and `</dfn>`.

Speaker notes are removed by script before audience see the slide. *FIXME: Remove them on the sever side.*

```
// Do not show this line to the audiences //
```

#### Segments ⚒²

*FIXME: This causes horizontal line rendered visually*

A single slide can be divided into multiple stages by using segment symbol `- - - ` :

```
# Today's Meeting
## Topic 1
- - -
## Topic 2
```

**Note:** The horizontal line should not be rendered.

#### Sidebar ⚒3
Three pipes `|||` or `| | |` indicate a `Sidebar` or an HTML 5 `<aside>` tag, which will float the remaining content inside the heading scape to the right:

```
|||
Players:
- USA
- China
- Russia
- Japan
```

**Note:** A single slide may contain more than one side bar.

#### Chart ⚒4

Draw simple charts in HTML 5:

##### Simple Bar

Syntax:

```
=> Label1 Value1 <=> label2 Value2 ~~Type
```

Value must be an integer ranging from `0` to `100`.

Example:

```
=> China 65 <=> USA 72 <=> Russia 33 ~~Bar
```

The above Markdown should be translated to:

```
<div class="chart-bar">
	<div class="bar-65">China</div>
	<div class="bar-72">USA</div>
	<div class="bar-33">Russia</div>
</div>
```

Theme decides how to render the HTML visually.

##### Multi-segment-bar

*Note: Future document will explain this section*

```
# Olympic Medals
=> China 65:71:85 <=> USA 64:72:86 <=> Russia 63:73:87 ~~Bar
```

In this example, numbers are extracted for column height, and country names are extracted for column label. 

- A colon symbol `:` between numbers indicate a **multi-domain** record
- A plus symbol `+` between numbers indicate a **multi-segment** record

Chart Type may be:

- Bar
- Pie
- Histogram
- Line
- Table

#### Checklist ⚒3

Static checklist:

```
[X] Option 1
[X] Option 2
[ ] option 3
```

#### Interactive Voting ⚒4

Single selection:

```
(?) Option 1
(?) Option 2
(?) Option 3
```

Multiple selections:

```
[?] Option 1
[?] Option 2
[?] option 3
```
